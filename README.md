## GIT vs GITHUB
GIT is a Version Control System for tracking changes in your computer files.
-	Distributed control system = Multiple developers can work on the same project without being on the same network
-	Coordinates work between multiple developers = tracks every single change that has been made on the project.
-	Allows you to revert to any specific commit change at any time as long it has been committed to the repository 
-	Local and remote repos.
Concepts of GIT
-	Keeps track of code history
-	Takes snapshots of your files (by making commits by single commands)
-	You decide when to take snapshot by making “commit”
-	You can visit any snapshot at any time
-	You can stage files before committing
## GIT commands
-	git init   // Initialize Local Repository
-	git add < file> // Add Files to Index
-	git add . // adds everything
-	git status // Checks Status of Working Tree (which files are in the in the index)
-	git commit // Commit Changes In Index
-	git push // Push Remote Repository
-	git pull  // Pull Latest From Remote Respository
-	git clone // Clones
-	rm -rf .git  // remove master
-	git checkout ‘code’ // takes you to back to the specific code
